= Introduction =

Cumberland provides an xml format that you can use to store and load maps.  It details such information as projection, layer data sources, symbology, and so forth.  Users may find it simpler to create their maps through xml, instead of through the API.

The map xml format is not a strict schema, in that any missing or out of place element will cause it to fail.  It just looks for a certain elements and ignores the rest.

= The top level Map element =

The xml document should prefaced as usual and have a 'Map' element at the root level:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Map version="0.1">
...
}}}

Applying the "version" attribute to the map forces cumberland to check the version.  If not set, cumberland will try to parse the xml.  If set, but to a version not supported, cumberland will throw an exception.

This element supports several child elements:

{{{
<Width>400</Width>
<Height>400</Height>
<Extents>-120,12,-82,34</Extents>
<Projection>+init=epsg:4326</Projection>
<Layers>
...
</Layers>
}}}

The Width/Height set the size of the image to draw in pixels.  The Projection defines the output projection of the map.  The extents define the portion of the map to draw.  Layers can hold zero to many 'Layer' elements.
