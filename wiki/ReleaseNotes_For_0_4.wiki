#summary Release Notes for 0.4

*_This page is a draft_*

= New Features =

 * Shapefile - support 'M' shapetypes (value is ignored)
 * Cascading styles - The Style class has had MinScale/MaxScale properties, but now they work as expected in that if a style is out of scale, it keeps looking.  Previously the scale properties were applied after the style was found.

== Line and Ring Simplification ==

Style now has Simplify and SimplifyTolerance properties which allows the ability to simplify features which can have the effect of making them appear nicer when zoomed far out ([http://www.salmonsalvo.net/blog/?p=205 details]).

= Fixes = 

 * #7 - tilepyramider throws exception when placed in PATH on Windows and called elsewhere
 * #8 - OverflowException is thrown
