#summary Release Notes for 0.4

= New Features =

 * Shapefile - support 'M' shapetypes (value is ignored)
 * Cascading styles - The Style class has had MinScale/MaxScale properties, but now they work as expected in that if a style is out of scale, it keeps looking.  Previously the scale properties were applied after the style was found.
 * added Style.UniqueElseFlag which can be used to style remaining features
 * label outlines have been improved on Microsoft .NET
 * added Layer.AllowDuplicateLabels.  Setting this to false will not draw a label string that has already been drawn for this Layer.

== Line and Ring Simplification ==

Style now has Simplify and SimplifyTolerance properties which allows the ability to simplify features which can have the effect of making them appear nicer when zoomed far out ([http://www.salmonsalvo.net/blog/?p=205 details]).

== switch to Well-Known Binary ==

Querying SQL Server and PostGIS previously used Well-Known Text.  This has been switched to Well-Known Binary.  The speed-up is substantial.

= Fixes = 

 * #7 - tilepyramider throws exception when placed in PATH on Windows and called elsewhere
 * #8 - OverflowException is thrown
