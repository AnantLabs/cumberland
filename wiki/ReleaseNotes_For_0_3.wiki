Several bugs were fixed in this release:

  * [http://code.google.com/p/cumberland/issues/detail?id=1&can=1 #1 -   	 shp2sqlserver: loading a polygon as geography fails].  This was a result of Sql Server 2008 requiring geography polygon's exterior rings to be counter-clockwise ([http://blogs.msdn.com/edkatibah/archive/2008/08/19/working-with-invalid-data-and-the-sql-server-2008-geography-data-type-part-1b.aspx details]).  By specification, Shapefiles use the opposite ring orientation.  [shp2sqlserver] now flips all polygon rings to conform to SQL Server.  This has the added plus of not forcing the db to flip ring orientation on geometries during spatial operations.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/cumberland/issues/detail?id=2&can=1 #2 - EndOfStreamException].  Cumberland now supports float columns in DBF files.
