#summary an overview of symbology supported in cumberland

= Introduction =

Symbology in this context mean the study of the symbols that represent cartographic features.  Cumberland currently provides a standard set of style option for creating beautiful maps.

All styling is done in the Style element which is a property of the Layer element.

= Line styles =

Lines in cumberland are styles with the following properties:

{{{
<Style>
	<LineWidth>1</LineWidth>
	<LineStyle>Solid</LineStyle>
	<LineColor>255,165,165,165</LineColor>
</Style>
}}}

LineWidth is the width of the line in pixels, LineColor is the color of the line in format (Alpha,Red,Green,Blue).  LineStyle is the style of line.  It can be Solid, Dashed, Dotted, or None.

LineStyle.None is not shown, as it would not draw the line.

= Polygon styles =

Polygon styles inherit the line styles for drawing the polygon and has an additional property: the FillColor:

{{{
<FillColor>255,240,255,208</FillColor>
}}}

The FillColor defines the interior color of the polygon.  The format is the same as LineColor.

= Point styles =

Currently, cumberland supports a limited set of symbology for points.  There are shapes, currently squares and rectangles, or external images.  To use shapes, set the following properties:

{{{
<PointSize>5</PointSize>
<PointSymbol>Shape</PointSymbol>
<PointSymbolShape>Square</PointSymbolShape>
}}}

The point size is the width/height of the square or the diameter of the circle.  The PointSymbolShape can be Square,Circle, or None.  The fill color, line styles for shape point symbols is inherited from polygons.  The PointSymbol element define the type of point symbol.  For external images, it is set to 'Image':

{{{
<PointSymbol>Image</PointSymbol>
<PointSymbolImagePath>images/city_icon.png</PointSymbolImagePath>
}}}

Note the relative path, this is interpreted as relative to the map xml file.  This allows the images to be bundled with the map.

An example of point symbols is found below.

= Thematic mapping =

Thematic mapping allows using particular styles based on a feature's properties.  For example, drawing states based on their population.  This must be configured in the Layer (see [mapXmlFormat#Layer_Elements])
