#summary create a kml document from a cumberland map

= Introduction =

map2kml is a command line tool that takes a [mapXmlFormat map xml document] and converts it into a Keyhole Markup Language (KML) document that can be loaded into Google Earth or Google Maps.  The usage is simple: it takes a single argument which is the path to your map file.

The kml document will preserve symbology (including thematic mapping) and export data from your feature source.  Each layer in your map will be a folder in the kml Document.

= Usage =

map2kml simply takes a [mapXmlFormat map xml file] as an argument and prints out the kml.  It canl be called as so:

{{{
map2kml mymap.xml > mymap.kml
}}}

This will pipe the kml into the mymap.kml file.

= Notes = 

  * All styles used in the map must have a unique Id property or they will be ignored.
